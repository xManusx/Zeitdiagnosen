* "What can complexity science and information systems contribute to saving human lives?" S vii

# Introduction
* Increase in Data, 4 reasons: Internet (global communication), WWW (network of globally accesible websites), social media, IoT S3
* "4 Vs of big data: volume, velocity (often realtime stream processing), variety (mostly unstructured), veracity (data contains errors, is not complete/representative" S 3 
* Digitalisation = digital revolution?
* Patronization by computers S 6
* Third way between communism and capitalism, cybernetic society S7
* Two "frameworks for the coming digital age": top-down (big government, benevolent dictator) and bottom-up (self-organizing systems, based on market force) S 11 ff
* ubiquity of digital technologies is giving rise to a digital society S 14
* "world in the digital age will be different" S 15
* book is about "prediction and control, complexity, self-organization, awareness and coordination, responsible decision-making, real-time measurement and feedback, systems design, innovation, reward systems, co-creation, and collective intelligence S 16

# Complexity Time Bomb --- When Systems get out of Control
* "Inner Threats" (financial instabilities, crime, crises, ...) now bigger than external threats (natural catastrophies/war) (S 17)
* 21st century problems can not be solved with 20th century wisdom (S 18)
* recessions as "traffic jams in the global flow of goods"? S 19
* components of complex dynamical systems frequently create new kinds of structures, properties and functions in a self-organized way (stop-and-go, riots) (S 20)
* world is strongly coupled dynamical system (worldwide trade, air traffic, the internet, social media, ...) -> Small actions can trigger catastrophic consequences, cascade effects (tweet sends stock market spinning, youtube video triggers riot) (S22)
* Complexity science view on financial systems predicted the crash 2008, because "increased level of complexity in the financial system was major problem and made system more vulnerable to cascade effects" (S26)
* Complex systems get out of control, even if everyone is well-informed, well-trained, uses advanced technology and has best intentions (S29)
* Our society is highly interconnected (political system, social system, food system, financial system) (S 28)
* Revolutionaries don't create revolutions, but systemic instabilities do.

# Social Forces --- Revealing the causes of success and disaster
* Like many physical phenomena are driven by hidden forces (e.g. gravity), success or failure of socio-economic systems depends on hidden forces too, which can be measured with new data about our world  (S 35)
* Idea of nervousnet - a global, real-time information network, that is open to everybody. (S 40)
* Idea of socio-physics (S 41)
* Knowledge about "social forces" enables researchers to understand between micro-level interactions between individuals and the often unexpected macro-level interactions in socio-economic systems (S 41)
* Similar to telescopes and stuff in phsycis, build "socioscopes", allowing us to measure these hidden social forces
* Example: Fluid-dynamic theory of pedestrians. Derived by newtons force laws, applied to individual pedestrians. Validated in simulations, then finally, after refinement using video footage of pedestrians, closely reproducing actual pedestrian flow. (S 44)
* Yielding unexpected findings: placing obstacles smartly in pedestrian flow can increase flow efficiency (S 45)
* Force modeling obviously works for pedestrian flows, but can we use it for other stuff, like crime or forming of opinions? Yes! => "social field", steepest slope in the "mountain range in the behavioral space is the social force, someone is subjected to (S 51)
* Basis of civilizations is culture = numerous set of rules, social conventions, values, norms, roles and routines (S 51)
* Mining on news articles of the last 100 years allows predictions of wars 6--12 months before the conflict (S 52)
* Punitive culture only works in non-multi-cultural societies - if punishment is not accepted, the punished party will simply retaliate => move to a reputation based culture (S 54)
* Social capital= everything that results from interactions within a social network which could potentially create benefits (e.g. public safety, culture of punctuality, reputation, trust, power, respect), factor in the success of societies (S 54)
* Social capital can easily be burned, e.g. after a plane crash or in a financial crisis, when trust erodes (S 55)
* Trust is only sustainable basis of power  and social order

# Google as God? The Dangerous Promise of Big Data
* What are the implications of god-like knowledge through aggregating all available data? (S 61)
* Given computers are better pilots, drivers, chess-players than us, why shouldn't they be better policemen, administrators, lawyers, politictians too? (S 63)
* Use digital crystal ball to predict the future, but what if people decide differently than predicted? Specifically tailored information could manipulate us, similar to personalized ads nowadays (S 65)
* Magic wand = control everything with access to all data (just assume something like that could exist), might lead to totalitarian society (S 65)
* Big Brother already is happening to some extent (predictive policing, mass surveillance), but also the wise king: for example manipulated search engine results (S 66)
* Goal function to maximise (as benevolent dictator) is not well defined (S 70)
* Three types of errors when categorising solutions to problems: Type I (False positives), Type II (false negatives) and too simple models (S 70)
* Such crystal balls are probably impossible (S 72)
* Magic wand with top-down-control would be very ineffective, bottom-up, questioning decisions and actions of others more beneficial (S 72)
* Human-influenced systems (e.g. society) too complex for benevolent dictator: dynamic complexity, structural complexity, functional complexity and algorithmic complexity --- Top-down approaches of governing this world must fail (S 75)

# Genie out of the Bottle --- Major socio-economic shifts ahead

* The digital revolution *will* come => we need to redesign our socio-economic systems to cope with surprises (S 83)
* Two models for dealing with the slowness of democracy: the china model and giving more control to multi-national corporations (S 83)
* China model (top-down governance) is not beneficial in the long term (S 84)
* Control by multi-national corporations is no option too, would be highly unstable due to monopolies, deaths of corporations, and fragmentation (S 85 f)
* Weird comparison of human brain and processing power and supercomputers (S 88)
* AI will get better and better => super AI (S 89)
* Information platforms and personal digital assitants could support us in creating collective intelligence, allowing us to keep up with AI (S 90)
* Can master digital revolution only if we create win-win-win (politics/business/citizens) situation (S 91)
* Delayed adaption causes systems to become unstable, gotta learn to cope with digital revolution (S 92)
* Countries which are first to recognize new principles of the 21st century will be leaders of the digital age. Other countries will be in trouble (S 94)
* Best way to deal with unpredictable future is to create flexibly adapting society, resilient systems(S 94)
* Resilience is ability to absorb shocks and to recover from them both quickly and thoroughly. (S 95)
* How to make resilient system: 
	* safety margins, reserves, backups, alternativs
	* modularization (intra-module connectivity > inter-module connectivity)
	* decentralization (local autonomy can improve proper adaption)
	* diversity (some units stay functional when system is disrupted, supports collective intelligence, increases innovation rate)
	* interoperability (S 95)
* Our society is not resilient (S 96)
* Rather than fighting properties of complex systems, use them for us, if we learn to understand their nature - using collective intelligence (S 97)

# Digitally assisted Self-Organization --- Making the invisible Hand work
* Rather than imposing a certain system behavior in a top-down way, assisted self-organization reaches efficient results by using the hidden forces, which determine the natural behavior of a complex dynamical system (S 103)
* Centralized control undermines self-organization, that is taking place all the time anyway - it often ends up being just fighting fires (S 104)
* Shift our attention from the nodes of a network to its links (S 104)
* Self-organizing systems (using the forces within the system rather than forcing the system to behave against "its nature") are somewhat resilient against disruptions (S 105)
* Assisted self-organization modifies the interactions between system components, but only where necessary (S 105)
* Distributed control works by helping the system components to adapt when they show signs of deviating too much from their normal/desired state. (S 106)
* Explanation of traffic jams/freeway capacity (S 108)
* VW adaptive cruise control (ACC) uses realtime measurements (radar) in individual cars to adapt individual behavior in a way that prevents/reduces traffic jams/stop and go (S 109 f)
* "Other regarding" (= minimize travel time at each intersection + immediatly clear queues above critical length) traffic light approach outperforms top-down approach and "selfish" approach (S 116)
* successfully tested in Dresden (S 117)
* Real-time top-down is not possible (complexity waaaay too high), but "other-regarding" distributed approach is both efficient and resilient to unforeseen circumstances (S 118)
* **Consider recessions being like traffic jams in the world economy, capital or product flows are obstructed or delayed - could we use realtime information about supply networks to minimize economic disruptions?** (S 121)
* "Wether self-organization in a complex dynamical system ends in success or failure largely depends on the interaction rules between a system's components. We need to make sure that the system components suitably respond to real-time information in such a way that they produce a favorable pattern, property, or functionality by means of self-organization. IoT is the enabling technology, that can now provide us with the necessary real-time data. Complexity science can teach us how to use this data." (S 122)

# How Society works --- Social order by self-organization
* Over-regulation has become unaffordable, self-organization is the solution (S 127)
* People can exploit "collective goods" (such as roads) without paying for it (S 128)
* Individual non-contribution is rewarding to the individual, as long as others are contributing enough --- tragedy of the commons (S 128)
* Mechanisms which can encourage and sustain cooperation:
	* Family relations - lots of undesirable side-effects (S 130)
	* Scared by future revenge/tit for tat strategy (S 130)
	* Costly (as it costs time and effort) punishment by peers enforces cooperative behavior (and social norms) (S 130)
* Moralists (cooperative and punishing) outperform hypocrits/defectors/second-order-free-riders when clustered according to behavior (S 132)
* In real world often pool punishment (police/judiciary system), but unclear who deserves to be punished and who is innocent. Also more surveillance and punishment does not actually fight crime (S 133)
* Migration can actually increase cooperation in societies, as cooperative individuals can form clusters that outperform uncooperative "anarchy" (S 133 ff)
* Interaction rules, leading to cooperation and efficient self-governance: clearly defined in/out-goup, self governance, sanctions for rule violations, conflict resolution, recognized by higher-level authority (S 135)
* To achieve cooperation, suitable interaction mechanisms/rules are needed, including mechanisms to reach compliance with the rules (S 136)
* When too many interactions/connections between agents, cooperation suffers (S 137)
* Altruistic signaling works best to indicate one is willing to invest in common goods, punishing non-cooperative behavior not best mechanism (S 138)
* Reputation mechanisms allows agents with compatible preferences and behaviors to find each other (S 139)
* Today's reputation systems result in filter bubbles, reputation systems of the future need to include more dimensions (e.g. physical, biological, environmental, technological and social qualities) and "pluralistic social filtering" (**wouldnt' this result in filter bubbles even more?!**)(S 140)
* Merit based matching (who pays more gets matched with other high-level investors and thus earns more) can turn downward spiral (leading to tragedy of the commons) into upward spiral (S 141)
* Can create social order and further benefits using sophisticated digital assistants (S 142)
* Avoid lose-lose interactions, information technologies can make us aware of possible negative side effects of an interaction (S 143)
* Win-lose interactions can be made win-win by compensating the losing party (S 143)
* Digital assistants could make us aware of possibilities/opportunities that would otherwise be missed (we walk past 100s of people who share interests with us without noticing) (S 143)
* These social technologies could become reality with smartphones

# Networked Minds --- Where Human Evolution is Heading
* Humans are curious by natures, social, information-driven species. That's why explosion in data volume and processing power will transform society more fundamentally than other techs in the past (S 147)
* Wisdom of Crowds: avg. of guesses about weight of an ox is incredibly close to actual weight (S 148)
* For wisdom of crowds to work: need independent information gathering, decentralized opinion formation and diversity of opinions (S 148)
* Instead of homo economicus, people are driven by a variety of different incentive systems and switch between them. (S 149)
* Intellectual curiosity is driver of human behavior (apart from basic needs as food, sex, etc.) (S 150)
* Lots of evolutionary psychology with questionable contents (S 150 f)
* If one desire is fulfilled, another incentive system takes over. Same when one desire is depraved for a long time: people compensate with fulfilling other kinds of rewards (S 152)
* Natural hierachy of desires; when a new industry emerges, it changes the character of society by placing additional weight on desires that didn't exist previously or were looming in the background (S 153)
* Computer simulation of prisoner's dilemma; "friendlyness" (amount of other-regarding in utility function) emerges from mutation during reproduction; in some cases (not much intergenerational migration, meaning children live close to parents with whom they are similar in regard to friendlyness (S 155 f)
* If lots of people are friendly, friendly behavior pays off (S 157)
* Conventional statistics can be enough to characterize homo economicus, but homo socialis are interdependent => Need complexity science! (S 159)
* Homo socialis may be best described by the term "networked minds" (S 159)
* Homo socialis is more successfull than homo economicus, even when only measured in terms of individual success. Invisible hand doesn't work for homo economicus (market failures), but workds for homo socialis that interacts with like-minded individuals considering externalities of decisions => Need new economic thinking, "economy 2.0" (S 159)
* Lesson from Netflix-Challenge: with complex problems, diversity wins, not the best approach => argument for democracy (S 160)
* Need knowledge base of trustable and unbiased information for collective intelligence to work (S 161)
* Neither top-down nor simple majority vote can cope with increasing complexity (S 162)
* Rather than simple majority vote, future success principle should be to get as many good ideas on board (diversity wins!) and produce as many "winners" as possible (S 163)
* Nowadays, spreading ideas or memes has become more important than spreading genes (S 165)
* Information systems support "networked minds" and enable "collective intelligence" (S 166)

# The Economy 4.0 --- A participatory market society is born
* Economy 4.0 = Paricipatory Market Society: characterized by uibiquity of information, bottom-up participation, "co-creation", self-organization and collective intelligence as new organizational principles (S 171)
* We need information platforms which can harness the diverse knowledge in our society and support more effective decision-making to overcome problems with growing complexity (S 172)
* World will change dramatically:
	* Personalized Education: Will need less standardized education but more personalized learning focused on imagination, creativit, innovation and collaboration (S 173)
	* Science will use Big Data as a method of generating hypothesises (S 174)
	* Health will use Big Data to make diagnoses more reliable or stop disease from spreading (such as flunearyou or influenzanet) (S 174)
	* Media already underwent dramatic changes from papers and TV to online journalism, blogs and streaming (S 176)
	* Legislation and regulation could become more flexible, more tailored towards local needs, more diverse; Tranfer responsibility for externalities to the beneficiaries instead of compensating through regulation (S 177)
* Economy is becoming more share-based right now (S 180)
* Democratization of Production is happening, people become "prosumers" (S 180)
* Shift from company-centric market to user-centric: Companies that don't care about consumers wishes and opinions will vanish, while those who do will flourish (S 180)
* Besides getting rich by cutting costs and rationalization, where immaterial goods are produced, co-creation and social synergy effects offer a second way of creating value (S 181)
* New forms of employment emerge (e.g. mechanical turk) (S 182)
* Project based socio-economic organization - no more companies but people working together on single projects. More flexible, avoids the Peter-Principle, already happening in the Open Source world (S 183)
* Top-Down enables fast decision making and reaching optimal outcomes if the goal is well defined and the system isn't too complex (S 185)
* Bottom-up works bet6ter under complex and highly variable conditions, if suitable coordination mechanisms are in place (e.g. immune system). good education and willingness to take responsibility at the bottom is required (S 186)
* Example for combining top-down and bottom-up strategies: Disaster recover
		People use apps such as *amigocloud* or *helping hands* to coordinate themselves with other people and help each other on a local level. Top-Down Emergency teams then can focus on problems and regions where people can't help themselves
* Other example: company experiences economic downturn. Instead of laying off people, engage people to find new product ideas, using skills, knowledge and machinery that are already available. If promising, turn them into spin-off companies
* Instead of creating walled gardens as Silicone Valley, Europe should catch up with an Open Data approach: data is/will be cheap, money would be made by distilling useful information from raw data and by distilling applicable knowledge from information (S 192)
* Homogenization of systems is a threat as it makes systems more vulnerable to disruptions (S 194)
* In the past built roads for industrial society and schools for service society, now build public institutions for digital society: open and participatory information platforms, supporting people to make better decisions, act more effectively and to coordinate and help each other (S 194)

# The Self-Organizing Society --- Taking the Future in our Hands
* Number of unexpected discoveries in this book:
	* Having/using more data is not always better => Overfitting, spurious correlations (p-hacking?), classification errors (S 199)
	* Even if individual decisions can be predicted with an error level of 5%, does not mean that macro level socio-economic outcome can be predicted well (S 199)
	* Even perfect knowledge of all individual component properties does not necessarily allow predictions about what happens when components interact in a complex dynamical system (S 200)
	* Most important issue: wether system is stable or unstable. (S 200)
	* Surprises will happen in complex socio-economic systems => Society should be organized in a way that can deal flexibly with disruptions (S 200)
	* In complex dynamical systems, distributed control can outperform top-down control attempts by flexibly adapting to local conditions and needs (S 200)
	* Centralized approaches may fail to identify variables that matter (just too much data around => flashlight effect) (S 200)
	* Diversity and complexity are not our problem. They come along with innovation, socio-economic differentiation and cultural evolution. But we need to learn how to use these to our advantage => understand hidden forces behind socio-economic change and use self-organization and digital assistants (using artificial and collective intelligence) to support coordination of actors with diverse interests and goals. (S 201)
* Diversity is crucial for distributed collective intelligence, which is better suited to respond to the combinatorial complexity of our world than an artificial superintelligence (S 201)
* Cybernetic/technocratic society vs. synergetic society = builds on local coordination of autonomous processes and on catalyzing mutual benefits (S 201)
* Supercomputers can't optimize our wolrd in real-time, the data-driven crystal ball and magic wand are not possible (S 202)
	* Increase in data outmatches increase in computing power (S 202)
	* Complexity of man-made systems grows faster than data volume => relative lack of computational power will increase rather than decrease (S 202)
	* Right now: policymakers try to control complexity7 from top-down, using regulations => high over-regulation and high debt
	* Don't need more power to solve problems of our world, but more wisdom and more citizen participation (S 202)
* Idea of a benevolent dictator always leads to totalism and is doomed to fail (S 203)
* We need collective intelligence, which requires diversity rather than conformity (S 204)
* Key to success is symbiotic relationship between companies, digitally literate citizens, customers and users; creating a win-win-win situation (business, citizens, state) (S 204)
* Negative outcomes of self-organization (traffic jams, crows disasters, financial crisis, ...) can be avoided by changing the interaction rules (S 205)
* Sensor networks behind IoT enable us to realize Smith's vision of self-organizing systems => need to change the way we think about global governance (S 205)
* Instead of measuring everything with IoT and storing the data, produce Smart Data approach: tailured measurements produce temporary data for specific users (S 206)
* How to make invisible hand work:
	* Externalities (reputation, happiness, wealth, emissions, waste, noise, ...) can be altered by introducing or modifying feedback loops, for example by introducing value exchange. In economic systems feedback is provied by financial costs or rewards, in social systems common to use incentives or sanctions. But other kinds of information exchange and coordination mechanisms are more efficient ("altruistic signaling" for example)
	* Single feedback mechanism (e.g. money) is too restricted to let complex socio-economic system self-organize => need multi-dimensional incentive and value exchange system (S 206)
	* Nervousnet can measure externalities and feed them back to decision-making entities, s.t. efficient and desirable outcomes are produced
* Digital assistants could help us create situational awareness, including potential side effects and risks implied by certain decisions and interactions (S 207)
* The secrets of self organization: (S 208)
	* Based on simple local interactions which enable mutual adaption
	* Example: Social norms, based on compliance mechanisms such as sanctions and rewards
	* In our economy: money only reward mechanism => one dimensional
	* Need multi-dimensional incentive and exchange system => reputation systems, ratings, scores
	* Self-rule fosters socio-economic diversity, innovation, happiness and resilience of the overall system
	* Favorable self-organization requires an active endeavor to find and implement suitable set of rules
* New Interaction rules can be found using simulations, lab/web experiments, interactive online-player games or Virtual Worlds (S 209)
* Can try to find the hidden mechanisms behind the world's cultures. Those are implicit right now, but could be made explicit (S 209)

* Proposals for immediate action (S 213)
	* Improve systemic resilience: Build "shock absorbers"/"engineered breaking points" into our systems, which can stop cascades by decoupling parts of the system. Learn to understand and use diversity as an asset: to achieve sustainable and good systemic solutions, it's important to combine diverse solutions in ways that create "collective intelligence" and resilient systems.
	* Reduce laws and regulations in order to support diversity and its many positive side effects: every law could have a limited term of validity. No "one-size-fits-all" solution, but choice of two or three options, based on best practice. Then, a culturally and locally fitting solution can be found. In many cases, compulsory regulations could be replaced by guidelines (S 214)
	* Build a reputation system to promote awareness, quality and responsible action: attempts to manipulate rankings or to spam the system should be discouraged; facts, advertisements and opinions should be distinguishable, anonymous, pseudonymous or public ratings should be possible, but weighted differently
	* Rebalance top-down and bottom-up decision-making according to the well-established principle of subsidiarity: use information systems and multi-dimensional reward systems to coordinate local activities, faciliate self-regulation. 
	* Establish a new data format based on the data cord principle (subject of personal data owns it) to enable informational self-determination and micro-payments (the more often data is used or copied, the generated profit would be distributed to different beneficiaries on the value-generating chain)
	* Create a multi-dimensional financial system to have a backup system and make our financial system more functional and resilient: create complementary, multi-dimensional financial system
	* Use information systems and other measurement methods to determine externalities and compensate for them: Reward people and companies for external benefits created by them. Make people pay for the damage they produce => need infrastracture to measure and quantify benefits and damages => IoT (S 216)
	* Tax systemic risks and provide rewards for transparency, responsibility, data access, informational self-determination, and open innovation
	* Build the infrastructure and institutions for the digital society: Similar to Apollo space program
