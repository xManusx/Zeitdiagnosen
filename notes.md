* "What can complexity science and information systems contribute to saving human lives?" S vii

# Introduction
* Increase in Data, 4 reasons: Internet (global communication), WWW (network of globally accesible websites), social media, IoT S3
* "4 Vs of big data: volume, velocity (often realtime stream processing), variety (mostly unstructured), veracity (data contains errors, is not complete/representative" S 3 
* Digitalisation = digital revolution?
* Patronization by computers S 6
* Third way between communism and capitalism, cybernetic society S7
* Two "frameworks for the coming digital age": top-down (big government, benevolent dictator) and bottom-up (self-organizing systems, based on market force) S 11 ff
* ubiquity of digital technologies is giving rise to a digital society S 14
* "world in the digital age will be different" S 15
* book is about "prediction and control, complexity, self-organization, awareness and coordination, responsible decision-making, real-time measurement and feedback, systems design, innovation, reward systems, co-creation, and collective intelligence S 16

# Complexity Time Bomb --- When Systems get out of Control
* "Inner Threats" (financial instabilities, crime, crises, ...) now bigger than external threats (natural catastrophies/war) (S 17)
* 21st century problems can not be solved with 20th century wisdom (S 18)
* recessions as "traffic jams in the global flow of goods"? S 19
* components of complex dynamical systems frequently create new kinds of structures, properties and functions in a self-organized way (stop-and-go, riots) (S 20)
* world is strongly coupled dynamical system (worldwide trade, air traffic, the internet, social media, ...) -> Small actions can trigger catastrophic consequences, cascade effects (tweet sends stock market spinning, youtube video triggers riot) (S22)
* Complexity science view on financial systems predicted the crash 2008, because "increased level of complexity in the financial system was major problem and made system more vulnerable to cascade effects" (S26)
* Complex systems get out of control, even if everyone is well-informed, well-trained, uses advanced technology and has best intentions (S29)
* Our society is highly interconnected (political system, social system, food system, financial system) (S 28)
* Revolutionaries don't create revolutions, but systemic instabilities do.
