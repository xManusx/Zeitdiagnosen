* "What can complexity science and information systems contribute to saving human lives?" S vii

# Introduction
* Increase in Data, 4 reasons: Internet (global communication), WWW (network of globally accesible websites), social media, IoT S3
* "4 Vs of big data: volume, velocity (often realtime stream processing), variety (mostly unstructured), veracity (data contains errors, is not complete/representative" S 3 
* Digitalisation = digital revolution?
* Patronization by computers S 6
* Third way between communism and capitalism, cybernetic society S7
* Two "frameworks for the coming digital age": top-down (big government, benevolent dictator) and bottom-up (self-organizing systems, based on market force) S 11 ff
* ubiquity of digital technologies is giving rise to a digital society S 14
* "world in the digital age will be different" S 15
* book is about "prediction and control, complexity, self-organization, awareness and coordination, responsible decision-making, real-time measurement and feedback, systems design, innovation, reward systems, co-creation, and collective intelligence S 16

# Complexity Time Bomb --- When Systems get out of Control
* "Inner Threats" (financial instabilities, crime, crises, ...) now bigger than external threats (natural catastrophies/war) (S 17)
* 21st century problems can not be solved with 20th century wisdom (S 18)
* recessions as "traffic jams in the global flow of goods"? S 19
* components of complex dynamical systems frequently create new kinds of structures, properties and functions in a self-organized way (stop-and-go, riots) (S 20)
* world is strongly coupled dynamical system (worldwide trade, air traffic, the internet, social media, ...) -> Small actions can trigger catastrophic consequences, cascade effects (tweet sends stock market spinning, youtube video triggers riot) (S22)
* Complexity science view on financial systems predicted the crash 2008, because "increased level of complexity in the financial system was major problem and made system more vulnerable to cascade effects" (S26)
* Complex systems get out of control, even if everyone is well-informed, well-trained, uses advanced technology and has best intentions (S29)
* Our society is highly interconnected (political system, social system, food system, financial system) (S 28)
* Revolutionaries don't create revolutions, but systemic instabilities do.

# Social Forces --- Revealing the causes of success and disaster
* Like many physical phenomena are driven by hidden forces (e.g. gravity), success or failure of socio-economic systems depends on hidden forces too, which can be measured with new data about our world  (S 35)
* Idea of nervousnet - a global, real-time information network, that is open to everybody. (S 40)
* Idea of socio-physics (S 41)
* Knowledge about "social forces" enables researchers to understand between micro-level interactions between individuals and the often unexpected macro-level interactions in socio-economic systems (S 41)
* Similar to telescopes and stuff in phsycis, build "socioscopes", allowing us to measure these hidden social forces
* Example: Fluid-dynamic theory of pedestrians. Derived by newtons force laws, applied to individual pedestrians. Validated in simulations, then finally, after refinement using video footage of pedestrians, closely reproducing actual pedestrian flow. (S 44)
* Yielding unexpected findings: placing obstacles smartly in pedestrian flow can increase flow efficiency (S 45)
* Force modeling obviously works for pedestrian flows, but can we use it for other stuff, like crime or forming of opinions? Yes! => "social field", steepest slope in the "mountain range in the behavioral space is the social force, someone is subjected to (S 51)
* Basis of civilizations is culture = numerous set of rules, social conventions, values, norms, roles and routines (S 51)
* Mining on news articles of the last 100 years allows predictions of wars 6--12 months before the conflict (S 52)
* Punitive culture only works in non-multi-cultural societies - if punishment is not accepted, the punished party will simply retaliate => move to a reputation based culture (S 54)
* Social capital= everything that results from interactions within a social network which could potentially create benefits (e.g. public safety, culture of punctuality, reputation, trust, power, respect), factor in the success of societies (S 54)
* Social capital can easily be burned, e.g. after a plane crash or in a financial crisis, when trust erodes (S 55)
* Trust is only sustainable basis of power  and social order

# Google as God? The Dangerous Promise of Big Data
* What are the implications of god-like knowledge through aggregating all available data? (S 61)
* Given computers are better pilots, drivers, chess-players than us, why shouldn't they be better policemen, administrators, lawyers, politictians too? (S 63)
* Use digital crystal ball to predict the future, but what if people decide differently than predicted? Specifically tailored information could manipulate us, similar to personalized ads nowadays (S 65)
* Magic wand = control everything with access to all data (just assume something like that could exist), might lead to totalitarian society (S 65)
* Big Brother already is happening to some extent (predictive policing, mass surveillance), but also the wise king: for example manipulated search engine results (S 66)
* Goal function to maximise (as benevolent dictator) is not well defined (S 70)
* Three types of errors when categorising solutions to problems: Type I (False positives), Type II (false negatives) and too simple models (S 70)
* Such crystal balls are probably impossible (S 72)
* Magic wand with top-down-control would be very ineffective, bottom-up, questioning decisions and actions of others more beneficial (S 72)
* Human-influenced systems (e.g. society) too complex for benevolent dictator: dynamic complexity, structural complexity, functional complexity and algorithmic complexity --- Top-down approaches of governing this world must fail (S 75)

# Genie out of the Bottle --- Major socio-economic shifts ahead

* The digital revolution *will* come => we need to redesign our socio-economic systems to cope with surprises (S 83)
* Two models for dealing with the slowness of democracy: the china model and giving more control to multi-national corporations (S 83)
* China model (top-down governance) is not beneficial in the long term (S 84)
* Control by multi-national corporations is no option too, would be highly unstable due to monopolies, deaths of corporations, and fragmentation (S 85 f)
* Weird comparison of human brain and processing power and supercomputers (S 88)
* AI will get better and better => super AI (S 89)
* Information platforms and personal digital assitants could support us in creating collective intelligence, allowing us to keep up with AI (S 90)
* Can master digital revolution only if we create win-win-win (politics/business/citizens) situation (S 91)
* Delayed adaption causes systems to become unstable, gotta learn to cope with digital revolution (S 92)
* Countries which are first to recognize new principles of the 21st century will be leaders of the digital age. Other countries will be in trouble (S 94)
* Best way to deal with unpredictable future is to create flexibly adapting society, resilient systems(S 94)
* Resilience is ability to absorb shocks and to recover from them both quickly and thoroughly. (S 95)
* How to make resilient system: 
	* safety margins, reserves, backups, alternativs
	* modularization (intra-module connectivity > inter-module connectivity)
	* decentralization (local autonomy can improve proper adaption)
	* diversity (some units stay functional when system is disrupted, supports collective intelligence, increases innovation rate)
	* interoperability (S 95)
* Our society is not resilient (S 96)
* Rather than fighting properties of complex systems, use them for us, if we learn to understand their nature - using collective intelligence (S 97)

# Digitally assisted Self-Organization --- Making the invisible Hand work
* Rather than imposing a certain system behavior in a top-down way, assisted self-organization reaches efficient results by using the hidden forces, which determine the natural behavior of a complex dynamical system (S 103)
* Centralized control undermines self-organization, that is taking place all the time anyway - it often ends up being just fighting fires (S 104)
* Shift our attention from the nodes of a network to its links (S 104)
* Self-organizing systems (using the forces within the system rather than forcing the system to behave against "its nature") are somewhat resilient against disruptions (S 105)
* Assisted self-organization modifies the interactions between system components, but only where necessary (S 105)
* Distributed control works by helping the system components to adapt when they show signs of deviating too much from their normal/desired state. (S 106)
* Explanation of traffic jams/freeway capacity (S 108)
* VW adaptive cruise control (ACC) uses realtime measurements (radar) in individual cars to adapt individual behavior in a way that prevents/reduces traffic jams/stop and go (S 109 f)
* "Other regarding" (= minimize travel time at each intersection + immediatly clear queues above critical length) traffic light approach outperforms top-down approach and "selfish" approach (S 116)
* successfully tested in Dresden (S 117)
* Real-time top-down is not possible (complexity waaaay too high), but "other-regarding" distributed approach is both efficient and resilient to unforeseen circumstances (S 118)
* **Consider recessions being like traffic jams in the world economy, capital or product flows are obstructed or delayed - could we use realtime information about supply networks to minimize economic disruptions?** (S 121)
* "Wether self-organization in a complex dynamical system ends in success or failure largely depends on the interaction rules between a system's components. We need to make sure that the system components suitably respond to real-time information in such a way that they produce a favorable pattern, property, or functionality by means of self-organization. IoT is the enabling technology, that can now provide us with the necessary real-time data. Complexity science can teach us how to use this data." (S 122)

# How Society works --- Social order by self-organization
* Over-regulation has become unaffordable, self-organization is the solution (S 127)
* People can exploit "collective goods" (such as roads) without paying for it (S 128)
* Individual non-contribution is rewarding to the individual, as long as others are contributing enough --- tragedy of the commons (S 128)
* Mechanisms which can encourage and sustain cooperation:
	* Family relations - lots of undesirable side-effects (S 130)
	* Scared by future revenge/tit for tat strategy (S 130)
	* Costly (as it costs time and effort) punishment by peers enforces cooperative behavior (and social norms) (S 130)
* Moralists (cooperative and punishing) outperform hypocrits/defectors/second-order-free-riders when clustered according to behavior (S 132)
* In real world often pool punishment (police/judiciary system), but unclear who deserves to be punished and who is innocent. Also more surveillance and punishment does not actually fight crime (S 133)
* Migration can actually increase cooperation in societies, as cooperative individuals can form clusters that outperform uncooperative "anarchy" (S 133 ff)
* Interaction rules, leading to cooperation and efficient self-governance: clearly defined in/out-goup, self governance, sanctions for rule violations, conflict resolution, recognized by higher-level authority (S 135)
* To achieve cooperation, suitable interaction mechanisms/rules are needed, including mechanisms to reach compliance with the rules (S 136)
* When too many interactions/connections between agents, cooperation suffers (S 137)
* Altruistic signaling works best to indicate one is willing to invest in common goods, punishing non-cooperative behavior not best mechanism (S 138)
* Reputation mechanisms allows agents with compatible preferences and behaviors to find each other (S 139)
* Today's reputation systems result in filter bubbles, reputation systems of the future need to include more dimensions (e.g. physical, biological, environmental, technological and social qualities) and "pluralistic social filtering" (**wouldnt' this result in filter bubbles even more?!**)(S 140)
* Merit based matching (who pays more gets matched with other high-level investors and thus earns more) can turn downward spiral (leading to tragedy of the commons) into upward spiral (S 141)
* Can create social order and further benefits using sophisticated digital assistants (S 142)
* Avoid lose-lose interactions, information technologies can make us aware of possible negative side effects of an interaction (S 143)
* Win-lose interactions can be made win-win by compensating the losing party (S 143)
* Digital assistants could make us aware of possibilities/opportunities that would otherwise be missed (we walk past 100s of people who share interests with us without noticing) (S 143)
* These social technologies could become reality with smartphones

# Networked Minds --- Where Human Evolution is Heading
* Humans are curious by natures, social, information-driven species. That's why explosion in data volume and processing power will transform society more fundamentally than other techs in the past (S 147)
* Wisdom of Crowds: avg. of guesses about weight of an ox is incredibly close to actual weight (S 148)
* For wisdom of crowds to work: need independent information gathering, decentralized opinion formation and diversity of opinions (S 148)
* Instead of homo economicus, people are driven by a variety of different incentive systems and switch between them. (S 149)
* Intellectual curiosity is driver of human behavior (apart from basic needs as food, sex, etc.) (S 150)
* Lots of evolutionary psychology with questionable contents (S 150 f)
